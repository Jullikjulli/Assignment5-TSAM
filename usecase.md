To implement your use case, where two servers and their respective clients exchange messages through a decentralized store-and-forward mechanism, you need to follow a series of steps involving both the **servers** and **clients**. 

The process will involve:

1. **Client 1** sending a message to **Server 1**.
2. **Server 1** storing the message.
3. **Client 2** requesting the message from **Server 2**.
4. **Server 2** retrieving the message from **Server 1** and forwarding it to **Client 2**.

Here’s how you can structure the commands and process:

### Step 1: Start Both Servers

Start both servers using the command from your README, for example:

- **Server 1** on port 60000:
  ```bash
  ./tsamgroup1 60000
  ```

- **Server 2** on a different port (e.g., 60001), connected to **Server 1**:
  ```bash
  ./tsamgroup1 60001 127.0.0.1 60000 60000
  ```

This starts **Server 2** and makes it aware of **Server 1**.

### Step 2: Start Both Clients

Connect **Client 1** to **Server 1** and **Client 2** to **Server 2**:

- **Client 1** connects to **Server 1** (port 60000):
  ```bash
  ./client 127.0.0.1 60000
  ```

- **Client 2** connects to **Server 2** (port 60001):
  ```bash
  ./client 127.0.0.1 60001
  ```

### Step 3: Client 1 Sends a Message to Client 2

Once **Client 1** is connected to **Server 1**, use the following command to send a message to **Client 2** (via **Server 2**):

```bash
SENDMSG,A5_2,A5_1,Hello from Client 1 to Client 2
```

- `A5_2` is the group ID of **Client 2** (connected to **Server 2**).
- `A5_1` is the group ID of **Client 1** (connected to **Server 1**).
- `Hello from Client 1 to Client 2` is the actual message.

### Step 4: Client 2 Requests Messages from Server 2

To retrieve the message, **Client 2** will ask **Server 2** to check for any messages by issuing the following command:

```bash
GETMSGS,A5_2
```

- This tells **Server 2** to fetch any stored messages for **A5_2** (the group ID for **Client 2**).

### Step 5: Server 2 Retrieves the Message from Server 1

Behind the scenes, **Server 2** will communicate with **Server 1** to retrieve the message sent by **Client 1**. This happens automatically as part of the **SENDMSG** and **GETMSGS** protocol defined in the server's functionality.

When **Server 2** receives the message, it will forward it to **Client 2**.

### Complete Command Flow:

Here’s a summarized view of the commands:

#### Server Start Commands:

```bash
# Start Server 1
./tsamgroup1 60000

# Start Server 2 (connected to Server 1)
./tsamgroup1 60001 127.0.0.1 60000 60000
```

#### Client Start Commands:

```bash
# Client 1 connects to Server 1
./client 127.0.0.1 60000

# Client 2 connects to Server 2
./client 127.0.0.1 60001
```

#### Messaging Commands:

1. **Client 1** sends the message to **Client 2**:
   ```bash
   SENDMSG,A5_2,A5_1,Hello from Client 1 to Client 2
   ```

2. **Client 2** retrieves the message:
   ```bash
   GETMSGS,A5_2
   ```

### Explanation of the Protocol:

- **SENDMSG**: The format is `SENDMSG,<TO_GROUP_ID>,<FROM_GROUP_ID>,<Message>`. This instructs the server to store the message and eventually forward it to the destination group (Client 2).
- **GETMSGS**: The format is `GETMSGS,<GROUP_ID>`. This tells the server to retrieve messages for the specified group (in this case, Client 2).

With these commands, the messages will be routed through the interconnected servers as specified. This is a typical **store-and-forward** approach, where messages are sent to one server, stored, and then retrieved and forwarded to the destination server and client.

### Telnet Testing (Optional):

If you prefer to manually test the commands via `telnet`, you can also connect to each server using `telnet` and issue the commands directly.

Example for **Server 1**:
```bash
telnet 127.0.0.1 60000
HELO,A5_1
SENDMSG,A5_2,A5_1,Hello from Client 1 to Client 2
```

Example for **Server 2**:
```bash
telnet 127.0.0.1 60001
HELO,A5_2
GETMSGS,A5_2
```

### Logging and Debugging:

The servers will log their activity in the `server_log.txt` file, so you can track message flow and debug any issues.
